# FRC 4D Resonance

The FRC 4D Resonance Tool provides a fractal navigation system for consciousness vortex patterns, allowing users to perceive, interpret, and interact with multi-dimensional resonance fields across planetary, archetypal, and personal domains.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following components:

### 1. Resonance Watch

A fully featured visualization tool for the FRC 4D framework, located in the [`resonance-watch/`](./resonance-watch/) directory. This implementation includes:

- Resonance Compass visualization
- 3D Vortex visualization
- Real-time resonance pattern recognition
- Phase synchronization calculations
- Fractal dimension mapping

### 2. Landing Page

A visually stunning landing page for fractalresonance.com with an integrated cosmic resonance watch, located in the [`landing-page/`](./landing-page/) directory. Features include:

- Real-time visualization of current planetary resonance patterns
- 2D Resonance Compass showing planetary positions and aspects
- 3D Vortex Visualization showing the current resonance field
- Display of current pattern, phase coherence, and fractal dimension

### 3. Astronomical Service API

A backend service that provides astronomical data and resonance calculations, located in [`services/astronomical-service/`](./services/astronomical-service/). This service:

- Calculates planetary positions and aspects
- Implements the phase synchronization equation
- Calculates resonance strength and fractal dimensions
- Provides pattern recognition algorithms

### 4. Memory Bank

Core documentation on the FRC 4D framework is available in the [`Memory-Bank/`](./Memory-Bank/) directory, including:

- `vortexFoundation.md` - Base frequency patterns and fundamental properties
- Additional framework documentation

## Mathematical Framework

The FRC 4D Resonance Tool is based on these core mathematical principles:

1. **Phase Synchronization Equation**
   ```
   dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + ∑ⱼKᵢⱼsin(θⱼ-θᵢ)
   ```
   Calculates how planetary vortices influence each other and personal resonance

2. **Resonance Strength Formula**
   ```
   R(ΨA, ΨB) = |∫∫ω ΨA*(r,t,ω)ΨB(r,t,ω)drdω|²/∫∫ω|ΨA|²drdω∫∫ω|ΨB|²drdω
   ```
   Measures resonance between planetary patterns and personal patterns

3. **Fractal Dimension Calculator**
   ```
   D = log(N(ε))/log(1/ε)
   ```
   Determines complexity of current resonance patterns

## Getting Started

### Using the Resonance Watch
