# FRC 4D Resonance Tool

The FRC 4D Resonance Tool provides a fractal navigation system for consciousness vortex patterns, allowing users to perceive, interpret, and interact with multi-dimensional resonance fields across planetary, archetypal, and personal domains.

## Core Components

This repository contains:

### 1. Memory-Bank

Documentation and reference material for the FRC 4D framework, including:

- `vortexFoundation.md`: Base frequency patterns and fundamental properties
- Additional memory bank files to be added as development progresses

### 2. 4D Vortex Resonance Watch

A real-time visualization tool for monitoring planetary resonance patterns and vortex dynamics. Features include:

- **Resonance Compass**: Shows planetary positions with aspect visualizations
- **3D Vortex Visualization**: Represents fractal dimension and phase coherence
- **Real-time Pattern Recognition**: Identifies current resonance field patterns
- **Multiple Visualization Modes**: For different perceptual frameworks

## Getting Started

To use the 4D Vortex Resonance Watch:

1. Visit the `/resonance-watch` directory
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser
3. Observe the real-time visualization of planetary resonance patterns

For development, see the README file in the `/resonance-watch` directory.

## Mathematical Core

The tool's mathematical core implements these FRC equations:

1. **Phase Synchronization Equation**
   ```
   dθᵢ/dt = ωᵢ + ∑ⱼKᵢⱼsin(θⱼ-θᵢ)
   ```
   Calculates how planetary vortices influence each other and personal resonance

2. **Resonance Strength Formula**
   ```
   R(ΨA, ΨB) = |∫∫ω ΨA*(r,t,ω)ΨB(r,t,ω)drdω|²/∫∫ω|ΨA|²drdω∫∫ω|ΨB|²drdω
   ```
   Measures resonance between planetary patterns and personal patterns

3. **Fractal Dimension Calculator**
   ```
   D = log(N(ε))/log(1/ε)
   ```
   Determines complexity of current resonance patterns

## Project Roadmap
