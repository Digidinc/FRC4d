# Memory Bank Views

This directory will contain role-specific documentation views:

- `operator_view.md`: For day-to-day management
- `developer_view.md`: For implementation details
- `manager_view.md`: For progress and status tracking
- `onboarding_view.md`: For new team members
- `ai_assistant_view.md`: Optimized for AI consumption

These views will be created as the project develops and specific roles are defined.
